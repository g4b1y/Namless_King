2D Game from Scratch 

#About the Game 
The Nameless King is a 2D Game created with JAVA Swing.
As IDE i used IntelliJ from JetBrains. The project took me around 1/2 week to plan 
and around 4 weeks to program (without writing documentation). 
The project took me around 1/2 week to plan and around 4 weeks to program 
(without writing documentation). The enemies and the player images are "stolen" 
and inspired by the game Dead Cells from Motion Twin (a company from Franceand) and Evil Empires 
(a Team of ex-Motion Twin developers and Graphic Designers but also new Recruits). 

I did not come as far as I wanted. I wanted to make it possible to move the player and fight 
against enemies (invent an Inventory). But it took a lot of time to create a level editor 
(that makes it possible to drag and drop entities, get the coordinates and create a function that 
makes it possible to change the grid size), but more on that later.
